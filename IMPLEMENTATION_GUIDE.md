# 🎯 HealthYoda Implementation Guide - Agents SDK with Tool Calling

## Executive Summary

You now have a **production-ready AI medical assistant** that uses the **OpenAI Agents SDK** for real-time voice conversations with **automatic tool calling** for dynamic RAG integration.

### What This Means

- ✅ **Voice I/O**: Patients speak, AI responds naturally
- ✅ **Tool Calling**: OpenAI automatically calls tools when needed
- ✅ **RAG Integration**: Medical frameworks retrieved dynamically
- ✅ **Evidence-Based**: Questions follow medical best practices
- ✅ **Summary Generation**: Professional reports auto-generated

---

## What Was Built

### Frontend (React + Agents SDK)

```typescript
// Two tools defined with Zod schemas:

1. get_relevant_questions
   - Triggered: When OpenAI needs medical guidance
   - Input: Patient symptom/complaint
   - Output: Medical framework from handbook
   - Effect: Shapes optimal follow-up questions

2. generate_medical_summary
   - Triggered: When conversation is complete
   - Input: Full conversation transcript
   - Output: Structured medical report
   - Effect: Provides actionable summary for doctors
```

### Backend (Node.js)

```javascript
// New endpoint for Agents SDK:
GET /client-secret
  Returns: Ephemeral WebRTC token

// Modified endpoints (now receive tool calls):
POST /rag        // RAG framework retrieval
POST /summary    // Medical report generation
```

### AWS RAG Service

```python
# Unchanged but now called dynamically:
POST /rag        // FAISS vector similarity search
                 // Returns medical frameworks
```

---

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /home/vinay/projects/freelance/healthyodha/frontend
npm install @openai/agents zod
```

### 2. Verify Services are Running

```bash
# Terminal 1 - RAG Service
cd /home/vinay/projects/freelance/healthyodha/rag_service
./start.sh
# Runs on: http://localhost:3000

# Terminal 2 - Backend
cd /home/vinay/projects/freelance/healthyodha/backend
./start.sh
# Runs on: http://localhost:3001

# Terminal 3 - Frontend
cd /home/vinay/projects/freelance/healthyodha/frontend
npm run dev
# Runs on: http://localhost:5173
```

### 3. Open Browser

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

## How It Works (Step by Step)

### Initialization

1. User opens browser → Clicks "Start Conversation"
2. Frontend calls `GET /client-secret` → Gets ephemeral token
3. Frontend creates RealtimeAgent with two tools
4. Frontend creates RealtimeSession and connects

### Conversation Flow

```
1. User speaks: "I have chest pain"
   ↓
2. OpenAI Realtime API transcribes audio
   ↓
3. OpenAI recognizes: "I should call get_relevant_questions tool"
   ↓
4. Frontend tool executes:
   - Calls: POST /rag with {query: "chest pain"}
   - Backend queries AWS RAG service
   - Gets medical framework
   ↓
5. OpenAI receives framework and generates question:
   "Thank you. When did this chest pain start?"
   ↓
6. Frontend converts to speech and plays
   ↓
7. User responds → Repeat from step 2
```

### Summary Generation

```
When OpenAI has gathered enough information:
   ↓
1. OpenAI calls: generateMedicalSummary tool
   ↓
2. Frontend tool executes:
   - Calls: POST /summary with conversation transcripts
   - Backend generates structured report using GPT-4o-mini
   ↓
3. Report displayed to doctor
   ↓
4. Doctor can copy summary or start new session
```

## Testing

### Test 1: Quick Connection Test

```bash
# Test backend is running
curl http://localhost:3001/client-secret

# Should return: {"client_secret":{"value":"...","expires_at":"..."}}
```

### Test 2: RAG Tool Test

```bash
# Test RAG endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/rag \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"chest pain","k":2}'

# Should return: {"context":"...","sources":[...],"num_chunks":2}
```

### Test 3: Full Conversation Test

1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Click "🎙️ Start Conversation"
4. Say: "I have chest pain"
5. Watch browser console for:
   ```
   🔍 Tool called: Retrieving questions for symptom: "I have chest pain"
   ✅ RAG Tool Response: 2 chunks from 2 sources
   ```
6. Listen for AI response
7. Verify AI asks about onset, quality, severity (from medical framework)

### Test 4: Summary Test

1. Continue conversation (5-10 exchanges)
2. Listen for: "I've gathered sufficient information"
3. Watch console for:
   ```
   📝 Tool called: Generating medical summary
   ✅ Medical summary generated
   ```
4. Summary appears on screen

## Environment Variables

Currently using `.env` in project root:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
RAG_SERVICE_URL=http://15.206.157.127:3000
PORT=3001
```

**Important**: RAG_SERVICE_URL points to your AWS RAG service (not localhost)

For local development with AWS RAG:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
RAG_SERVICE_URL=http://15.206.157.127:3000
PORT=3001
```

For local development with local RAG:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
RAG_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3000
PORT=3001
```

---

## Setup for AWS Deployment

### .env Configuration

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
RAG_SERVICE_URL=http://15.206.157.127:3000
PORT=3001
```

### Backend Behavior

- Backend runs locally (or on EC2)
- Backend forwards `/rag` calls to RAG_SERVICE_URL
- RAG service runs on AWS/EC2 (http://15.206.157.127:3000)
- Tool calls go: Frontend → Backend → AWS RAG Service

### What's Running Where

```
Local Machine:
  - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
  - Backend: http://localhost:3001

AWS/EC2 Server:
  - RAG Service: http://15.206.157.127:3000
  - Frontend (optional): http://15.206.157.127:5173
```

---

## Deployment to EC2

### Build Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

### Copy to EC2

```bash
scp -i /path/to/mahe-server.pem \
  -r dist/* \
  ubuntu@15.206.157.127:~/healthyodha/frontend/
```

### Update API URLs

In `frontend/src/App.tsx`, change:

```typescript
// Change this:
"http://localhost:3001/client-secret";

// To this:
"http://15.206.157.127:3001/client-secret";
```

### Start on EC2

```bash
ssh -i mahe-server.pem ubuntu@15.206.157.127
cd healthyodha
./start-all.sh
```

### Access

```
Frontend: http://15.206.157.127:5173
RAG API: http://15.206.157.127:3000 (public)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Connection refused" error

**Solution**: Ensure services are reachable

```bash
# Test backend
curl http://localhost:3001/client-secret

# Test AWS RAG (from backend machine)
# Backend should be able to reach: $RAG_SERVICE_URL/health
```

### Issue: Tool not executing / "Failed to retrieve medical framework"

**Solution**: Check RAG_SERVICE_URL configuration

```bash
# Verify .env has correct RAG_SERVICE_URL
cat .env | grep RAG_SERVICE_URL

# Test RAG service is accessible from backend machine
# If RAG is on AWS, ensure:
# 1. AWS security group allows port 3000
# 2. Backend can reach AWS IP
# 3. RAG_SERVICE_URL in .env is correct
```

### Issue: RAG returns empty or wrong data

**Solution**:

- Check handbook.txt has medical data
- Verify RAG service is running on AWS
- Check RAG service logs on AWS

---

## Performance Considerations

### Tool Call Latency (with AWS RAG)

- Backend to AWS RAG roundtrip: ~500-1000ms
- Total conversation latency: ~4-6 seconds (includes audio delays)

### Optimization Tips

- Keep RAG queries focused (currently k=2)
- Ensure AWS and backend have good network connection
- Use VPC if both on AWS for faster communication
- Monitor AWS bandwidth usage

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test Locally**: Follow testing section above
2. **Deploy to EC2**: Use deployment guide
3. **Monitor**: Watch console logs and backend logs
4. **Iterate**: Improve medical framework in handbook.txt
5. **Scale**: Add more medical conditions/frameworks

✅ Browser requests microphone permission  
✅ Tool calls visible in console  
✅ Medical framework retrieved from RAG  
✅ AI asks evidence-based questions  
✅ Summary generated automatically  
✅ Report displays to doctor
