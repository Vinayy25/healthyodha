# 🎉 Updated Features - Always-On RAG + Medical Summary

## What's New

### 1. ✅ Always-On RAG (No Toggle Needed)

**Before:**

- RAG was optional with a checkbox
- Only triggered on specific keywords (chest, pain, headache, etc.)
- User had to manually enable it

**After:**

- RAG is **always active** and automatic
- No checkbox needed
- Continuously fetches relevant context from handbook
- Debounced to avoid overwhelming requests (fetches every 500ms max)

### 2. ✅ Continuous Context Fetching

**How it works:**

1. Patient speaks (any input)
2. System extracts their latest message
3. Waits 500ms (debounce)
4. Automatically fetches relevant medical frameworks from handbook
5. Displays context in right panel for AI to reference

**Benefit:** The AI always has context-aware information to ask the right follow-up questions

### 3. ✅ Auto-End Conversation Detection

**Listens for ending keywords:**

- "thank you"
- "goodbye"
- "thanks"
- "that's all"
- "i'm done"
- "that's it"

**When detected:**

- Shows "⏱️ Conversation ended - generating summary..." indicator
- Automatically triggers summary generation
- No manual button click needed (though button still available)

### 4. ✅ Medical Summary Generation for Doctors

**Automatic Report Generated:**

```
📋 Medical Summary Report

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
[Patient's main concern]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
- Onset/Duration: [When and how long]
- Quality: [Description]
- Severity: [1-10 or descriptive]
- Aggravating Factors: [What makes worse]
- Relieving Factors: [What helps]
- Associated Symptoms: [Other symptoms]

RED FLAGS/CONCERNING SYMPTOMS:
[Any urgent items]

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY/CONTEXT:
[Background info]

ASSESSMENT & RECOMMENDATIONS:

```

**Doctor can:**

- ✅ View formatted professional report
- ✅ Copy to clipboard
- ✅ Share with other healthcare providers
- ✅ Start a new session immediately

## System Flow

```

    ↓
System Checks for Ending Keywords
    ↓
If Conversation Ended:
  └─→ Generate Medical Summary (GPT-4o-mini)
      ↓
      Display to Doctor
      ↓
      Option to Copy or Start New Session
```

## Code Changes

### Backend (`backend/server.js`)

**New `/summary` endpoint:**

```javascript
POST /summary
Body: { transcripts: [ {role, text}, ... ] }
Response: {
  summary: "Professional medical report...",
  transcripts_count: 12,
  generated_at: "2025-10-25T..."
}
```

**Uses GPT-4o-mini** for efficient, accurate summary generation

### Frontend (`frontend/src/App.tsx`)

**New Features:**

1. **Removed RAG toggle** - always active
2. **Continuous RAG fetching** - debounced every 500ms
3. **Auto-end detection** - checks last assistant message
4. **Summary generation** - calls backend when conversation ends
5. **Summary display screen** - replaces conversation after completion

**New State Variables:**

- `medicalSummary` - stores generated report
- `generatingSummary` - loading state
- `conversationEnded` - tracks end detection
- `ragDebounceTimer` - prevents RAG spam

**New Functions:**

- `isConversationEnding()` - keyword detection
- `generateSummary()` - calls backend `/summary`
- `endConversation()` - manual end with summary generation

## Workflow Example

**User**: "I've been having chest pain for 3 days"

**System immediately:**

1. ✅ Detects user input
2. ✅ Fetches RAG context (Cardiac - Chest Pain framework)
3. ✅ Shows framework in right panel
4. ✅ AI uses context to ask informed questions

**AI**: "I understand you've been experiencing chest pain for three days. Can you describe the quality of the pain - is it sharp, pressing, burning, or something else?"

**... conversation continues ...**

**User**: "Thank you so much for your help!"

**System immediately:**

1. ✅ Detects "thank you" keyword
2. ✅ Generates medical summary
3. ✅ Displays professional report
4. ✅ Shows "Copy to Clipboard" button

**Doctor receives:**

```
📋 Medical Summary Report

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Chest pain for 3 days

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
- Onset: 3 days ago
- Quality: Sharp, pressing sensation
- Severity: 7/10
- Aggravating Factors: With exertion, deep breathing
- Relieving Factors: Rest, antacids
- Associated Symptoms: Shortness of breath, anxiety

... etc ...
```

  "your custom keywords here",
];
```

### Adjust RAG Debounce Time

Edit `frontend/src/App.tsx` line ~222:
