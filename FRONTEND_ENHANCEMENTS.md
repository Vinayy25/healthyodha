# ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Enhancements - Detailed Status Display

## What's New

Enhanced the frontend UI to show detailed real-time information about what's happening during:
1. Connection initialization
2. RAG retrieval
3. Interview progress

## New Components

### 1. Connection Status Panel
Displays during connection attempt
```
ðŸ”§ SYSTEM STATUS
Connection: Requesting session token from backend...
```

Shows progression:
- Initializing agent...
- Creating AI agent...
- Requesting session token from backend...
- Token received. Creating WebRTC connection...
- Connecting to OpenAI via WebRTC...
- âœ… Connected! Microphone active. Ready to listen...

### 2. Interview Status Panel
Displays during active conversation
```
ðŸ“Š INTERVIEW STATUS
Connection: âœ… Connected! Microphone active...
Questions Asked: 3
Medical Framework: âœ… Retrieved 2 chunks for: "chest pain"
ðŸ“š RAG Details:
   Symptom: chest pain
   Chunks: 2 | Sources: cardiac_assessment, vital_signs
```

Shows:
- Connection status
- Question count (updates in real-time)
- RAG framework status
- Detailed RAG information

## New State Variables

```typescript
// Connection and status tracking
const [connectionStatus, setConnectionStatus] = useState<string>("Idle");
const [ragStatus, setRagStatus] = useState<string>("");
const [ragDetails, setRagDetails] = useState<{
  symptom: string;
  chunks: number;
  sources: string[];
} | null>(null);
const [questionCount, setQuestionCount] = useState(0);
```

## Enhanced Functions

### initializeAgent()
Now updates `connectionStatus` at each step:
- "Initializing agent..."
- "Creating AI agent..."
- "Requesting session token from backend..."
- "Token received. Creating WebRTC connection..."
- "Connecting to OpenAI via WebRTC..."
- "âœ… Connected! Microphone active. Ready to listen..."

### getRelevantQuestions() Tool
Now updates RAG tracking:
- Sets `ragStatus` to "Fetching medical framework from backend..."
- After RAG returns: `âœ… Retrieved 2 chunks for: "symptom"`
- Sets `ragDetails` with symptom, chunks, and sources

### history_updated Event Handler
Now increments `questionCount` for each AI message

## CSS Additions

```css
.status-panel {
  /* Purple gradient background */
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(79, 70, 229, 0.15) 0%, rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.1) 100%);
  border: 1px solid var(--border);
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 1rem;
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
}

.status-panel-title {
  font-weight: 600;
  color: var(--primary);
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

.status-item {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  padding: 0.5rem 0;
  border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(79, 70, 229, 0.2);
}

.rag-info {
  color: var(--text-muted);
  font-size: 0.85rem;
}

.rag-info strong {
  color: var(--success);
}
```

## User Experience

### During Connection:
1. User clicks "Start Voice Interview"
2. Status panel appears
3. User sees connection progress step-by-step
4. When connected, status changes to "âœ… Connected! Microphone active..."

### During Conversation:
1. Interview Status Panel shows connection status
2. Questions Asked count increases with each AI question (1, 2, 3, ...)
3. When RAG is called:
   - Shows "Fetching medical framework from backend..."
   - Then shows "âœ… Retrieved 2 chunks for: 'symptom'"
   - Shows RAG Details with:
     - Symptom being queried
     - Number of chunks retrieved
     - Sources used

## Benefits

### For End Users:
- See what's happening in real-time
- Understand connection process
- Know interview progress
- See RAG framework being used
- Transparency and confidence

### For Developers:
- Easy debugging with detailed status
- See RAG details for troubleshooting
- Question count verifies flow
- Connection status identifies issues
